/**
 * What went wrong, and what you can do about it.
 *
 * A failed forge used to render as `✗ forge failed · <whatever the state
 * machine said>`, which is a log line, not an answer. Each entry here says
 * what happened in the reader's terms and what the next move is.
 *
 * A note on what is NOT in this list, because it is the interesting part:
 * "no test suite", "not a Python repo", "dependency install failed" and "repo
 * too large" cannot reach a reader. BugForge never clones or installs at
 * request time -- every forgeable repo is a container image built ahead of
 * time on a trusted machine (see cloud/workspace.py), so those failures
 * happen weeks earlier, at image-build time, and the only runtime answer is
 * "there is no image for that repo", which the landing page already gives in
 * full. Entries for them are kept below anyway: if the pipeline ever grows a
 * clone-at-runtime path, the copy is already written and the matcher will
 * find it. `UNREACHABLE_TODAY` marks them so nobody mistakes them for live
 * behaviour.
