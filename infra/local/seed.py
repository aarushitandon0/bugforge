"""Load an already-forged corpus into the local stack, without the pipeline.

    python infra/local/seed.py phase5_output

The forge itself cannot run here. Every pipeline lambda is a container-image
function -- the repo and its test suite are baked into the image -- and
LocalStack **community** refuses to start one:

    Could not start new environment: NotImplementedError:
    Container images are a Pro feature.

Step Functions therefore fails on its first state, three retries deep, and the
tables stay empty, which is what an empty /repos and an empty /gaps are. The
two HTTP functions are unaffected, because `sam local start-api` runs them on
this machine's Docker rather than inside LocalStack.

So this writes what fn_persist would have written, from a real run's output
directory rather than from a live pipeline: the same DynamoDB items, the same
two S3 prefixes, the same keys. It substitutes for the *runtime*, not for the
pipeline -- the challenges, scores, tracebacks and trees here were all
produced by the real thing, offline.

Re-running is safe: every write is a put by primary key, so a second run
replaces the same items rather than adding to them.
