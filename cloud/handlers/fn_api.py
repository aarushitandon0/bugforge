"""The HTTP surface. One router; the interesting part is what it refuses to say.

Challenge responses carry the title, description, repo, licence, difficulty
and its three inputs, and the failing test names. They never carry the patch,
the mutated file, the line, or the operator: a learner who knows the file and
line has already solved it. Those fields are not in the challenges table to
begin with (see fn_persist), so this is belt and braces. The challenge id is
opaque for the same reason (see cloud/ids.py).

GET /challenges/{id}/tree presigns the PUBLIC prefix only, for ten minutes.
This function's execution role has no read access to answers/{id}/, so a bug
in the code below still cannot produce a URL to mutation.patch. The post-PASS
diff comes from fn_reveal, which has its own role and checks the verdict
itself; this function only relays its answer.

GET /forge/{id} is the live generation stream. It shows every classified
mutation, rejects included -- but a mutation that is (or may become) a
challenge is shown with its location masked, because the stream is public.

Identity comes from the session cookie and from nowhere else. POST
/submissions requires one; every other route stays open, because browsing
repos, challenges and the gap report needs no account. The user id is read
off the verified session, never off the request body -- a body-supplied id
would let anyone write to anyone else's leaderboard row.
