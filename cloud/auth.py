"""
GitHub sign-in: state tokens, session cookies, and the GitHub calls.

Everything in this module is pure except `exchange_code` and `fetch_user`,
which are the only two functions that talk to github.com. That split is
deliberate -- the signing, verification and cookie handling are where the
security actually lives, and they are unit-testable without a network.

**Sessions are signed, not stored.** A session is an HS256 JWT carrying the
GitHub numeric id, login and avatar, and nothing else. There is no session
table to look up and nothing to revoke; a session simply expires. That is the
right trade here because a session grants exactly one thing -- the right to
submit a patch as yourself -- and nothing a stolen one could do is worth a
round trip to DynamoDB on every request.

**Two separate secrets, on purpose.** The GitHub client secret is readable
only by fn_auth's role; it is the credential that can impersonate the whole
application to GitHub. The session signing key is readable by fn_auth (which
signs) and fn_api (which verifies), and can do nothing beyond mint sessions
for this stack. Collapsing them into one secret would hand every route the
ability to talk to GitHub as the app.

**Where the cookie has to work decides its attributes.** On AWS the web app
is on Amplify and the API is on execute-api, so the session cookie must be
`SameSite=None; Secure` and the API must send
`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` against a *specific* origin;
`WebOrigin="*"` and credentials are mutually exclusive by spec, so deploying
auth there requires a real WebOrigin -- see FEATURES.md, "Deploying". On the
single-origin HTTPS deployment and on local http the answers differ, and
getting the choice wrong is silent, so `cookie_mode()` names it rather than
guessing. See COOKIE_FLAGS below.
