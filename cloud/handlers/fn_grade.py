"""Grading. No model, no hidden tests, no heuristics.

    a. patch hygiene, via the AST (see cloud/anti_cheat.py)
    b. apply the patch to the broken tree
    c. run the FULL suite
    d. all green -> PASS, otherwise FAIL with the still-failing test names

The repo's own suite is the oracle. That works precisely because the mutation
was selected for being caught by that suite: a green run means the defect is
gone, and no separate answer key is consulted -- this lambda has no read
access to the answers prefix at all.

Invoked asynchronously; the submission row is updated in place and the client
polls GET /submissions/{id}.
