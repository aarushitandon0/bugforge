# BugForge

**Practice debugging on real open source code, with bugs nobody wrote by hand.**

BugForge takes a real repository, breaks it in one place, proves the break is
catchable by that repository's own test suite, and hands you the broken tree
with a failing test. You find the bug and patch it. The repository's real test
suite decides whether you were right. No model grades you, and the grading path
has no access to the answer.

## Why this exists

Every coding practice platform drills the same motion: blank editor, problem
statement, write a function from scratch. That is the part of the job a working
engineer does least.

The actual work, and increasingly the interview, is the opposite shape. You are
dropped into a codebase you did not write. Something is broken. There is a
stack trace, and it is pointing at a line that is not the problem. You have to
reason backwards from a symptom to a cause, in code you have never read.

Nobody practises that deliberately, because building the exercise is hard. You
need a codebase that is genuinely broken, broken in an interesting way, and a
guarantee that it is fixable.

BugForge generates those automatically. The load-bearing idea is that **a
mutation is only a good exercise if the repository's own tests catch it.** That
single filter buys three things at once:

- **A ground truth.** The bug is fixed when the suite goes green. Nothing else
  has to judge it, so there is no rubric, no model, and no answer key in the
  grading path.
- **A difficulty signal.** How far the failing test sits from the broken line,
  how many files that test executes, and how loudly it fails are all measurable
  before a human sees the challenge.
- **A byproduct that may be worth more than the challenges.** A mutation the
  suite does *not* catch is a hole in that repository's test coverage. Those are
  collected and published as a test gap report.

That last point deserves to be said plainly: the same machinery that makes
practice problems is a coverage auditor for any repository you point it at.

## Screens

### Forging a repo

![Landing page with the live forge stream](ss/1.png)

The run streams as it happens: 183 tests green at baseline, 120 candidates on
covered lines, 15 batches. Each row is one mutation and its verdict. Note the
`keep` rows have their file and line **masked**, because a learner who can read
the location off the stream has already solved the challenge. The `test gap`
rows are mutations the suite never noticed.

### Picking a bug

![The challenge grid for jd/tenacity](ss/4.png)

56 bugs from one repository, ordered easiest first, with the bands cut from this
repo's own score distribution rather than at fixed thresholds. Solved challenges
are ticked and the next unsolved one is highlighted. The test gap count links
through to the coverage report.

### Solving

![The solve screen, with the traceback walker and editor](ss/2.png)

The left rail is the parsed traceback, seven frames, clickable. `alt+[` and
`alt+]` walk it, opening each file at the right line. The gutter separates the
frame that **raised** from frames above it.

The right rail breaks difficulty into the three things that were actually
measured, never one opaque number. Test files open read-only, because the suite
is the grader.

This is the core of the product in one screenshot: the `TypeError` surfaces at
`wait.py:107`, and the bug is at `wait.py:51`.

### After a pass

![The reveal and the investigation replay](ss/3.png)

The mutation is revealed only after the suite goes green: one token, `self` to
`None`, with a link to the real line on GitHub at the pinned commit.

Below it, the investigation replay draws which files you opened and when against
the causal path from crash to cause, and says in a sentence whether you were
reading the right file.

### Your record

![The profile page](ss/5.png)

Solved against total, per band, a year of activity, streaks, and recent solves.
Signed out this still works from the browser's own record; signing in merges the
two rather than replacing one with the other.

## System architecture

BugForge is two systems that meet at a database. The **forge** is a batch
pipeline that turns a repository into challenges and runs on its own schedule.
The **app** is a read-mostly API over what the forge produced, plus one write
path: a submission, graded by running tests.

                                |
     a browser, on a Next.js static export that proxies /api/*
```

### The layers

| layer | lives in | what it knows |
|---|---|---|
| pipeline library | `bugforge/` | ASTs, coverage maps, test running, scoring. No AWS imports. |
| language adapters | `bugforge/languages/` | how one language locates a token, reads coverage, runs tests, extracts a failure |
| cloud handlers | `cloud/handlers/` | one file per function. Event in, dict out. |
| cloud helpers | `cloud/` | config, ids, S3 and DynamoDB access, auth, anti-cheat, the one model call |
| HTTP adapter | `server/app.py` | translates HTTP into the API Gateway event shape, off AWS only |
| web | `web/` | a static export that fetches everything client-side |

The direction of dependency is one way. `bugforge/` never imports `cloud/`, so
the pipeline is testable without AWS in scope at all, and the handlers are thin
enough that most of them are a dozen lines of wiring around a library call.

### The two seams

Every AWS call in the application path goes through exactly two functions:

```python
cloud/s3_io.py    client()   ->  a boto3 S3 client
cloud/ddb_io.py   table(name) ->  a boto3 DynamoDB Table resource
```

That is what makes the no-AWS deploy possible without a second copy of
anything. `cloud/local_store.py` supplies an object of each shape backed by a
directory and a SQLite file, so **no call site changes**: the handlers, the
grader and the API make the same calls they make against real AWS. It is
constructed only when `BUGFORGE_LOCAL_STORE` is set, so a real deployment
cannot fall into that path even though the module ships in the image.

Nothing beyond what a call site actually uses is emulated. There is no
BatchWrite, no filter expression and no pagination, so a future call site
needing one fails loudly rather than quietly returning the wrong rows.

### Three deployment shapes, one codebase

| shape | compute | storage | what stands in |
|---|---|---|---|
| **AWS** | Lambda, API Gateway, Step Functions, Amplify | S3 + DynamoDB | nothing |
| **LocalStack** | `sam local start-api`, LocalStack Lambda | LocalStack S3 + DynamoDB | forging, which needs a container-image Lambda |
| **No AWS** | one uvicorn process (`server/app.py`) | a directory + SQLite | S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway, the Lambda boundary |

The third shape is the one that runs on a plain container host with no AWS
account. `server/app.py` does not reimplement a single route. It holds the
deployed stack's route list, spelled exactly as API Gateway spells a
`routeKey`, builds the HTTP API v2 event the handlers already expect, calls the
same `fn_api.handler` and `fn_auth.handler`, and translates the returned dict
back into a response. Every rule about what the API will and will not say still
lives in `cloud/handlers/`, so there is no second copy of the routing to drift.

Two details of that port are load bearing rather than cosmetic:

- **Presigning.** A local store has nothing to sign with, so a presigned URL is
  a plain link to the process's own `/files` route. That route refuses any key
  not under `public/`, which is what carries the "answers are never presigned"
  invariant across the port. It is a refusal, not a filter.
- **Cookies.** API Gateway v2 answers with a `cookies` list rather than
  headers, because the callback leg sets two cookies on one response: it clears
  the OAuth state and plants the session. A dict of headers cannot express
  that, so the translation is covered by a test that drives a whole sign-in
  through the ASGI app with only the two GitHub network calls replaced.

### Startup checks

The no-AWS process refuses to start on a misconfiguration whose only runtime
symptom would be silence: an unrecognised cookie mode, a `Secure` cookie paired
with an `http://` callback, a `same_origin` cookie mode whose callback is not
under `WEB_ORIGIN`, GitHub OAuth configured with no session signing key, or the
fixed dev identity set anywhere it is not plain-http localhost. A container
that will not start is the loudest this can be made, and it is loud at deploy
time rather than when the first person tries to sign in.

---

## How the pipeline works

Eight stages orchestrated by AWS Step Functions, all running against one
container image with the target repository and its full test dependencies baked
in at build time. Nothing is cloned or installed at request time.

```
Baseline -> Generate -> AnyCandidates -> RunBatches -> Score -> ScoringComplete -> Describe -> Persist
```

### 1. Baseline (`cloud/handlers/fn_baseline.py`)

Run the suite once under coverage and build a **line-to-tests map**: for every
executable line, which tests actually execute it. This map is the spine of
everything downstream and is also inverted into a test-to-files map, which the
scorer uses for search space.

A repository whose suite is not green here is rejected outright. A red baseline
has no usable signal, and the container build runs the suite too so that this is
found at build time rather than fifteen minutes into a run.

### 2. Generate (`bugforge/mutate.py`)

Walk the AST and collect mutation sites. Eight operators:

| operator | example |
|---|---|
| `RETURN` | `return self` becomes `return None` |
| `BOUNDARY` | `<=` becomes `<` |
| `COMPARISON` | `==` becomes `!=` |
| `NEGATION` | `not x` becomes `x` |
| `BOOLEAN` | `and` becomes `or` |
| `ARITHMETIC` | `+` becomes `-` |
| `DEFAULT_ARG` | a default value is changed |
| `TYPE_CHECKING` | an `isinstance` check is flipped |

Each flips exactly one token. Only lines the baseline proved are covered become
candidates, so no time is spent on code no test reaches. Candidates are cut into
batches of roughly fifteen.

### 3. RunBatches

A Step Functions **Distributed Map** fans the batches out. Each worker applies
one mutation to a scratch copy of the tree and runs **only the tests the
baseline says cover that line**. This targeted run is what makes the whole thing
affordable: a full suite per mutation would be unusable at this candidate count.

### 4. Score and classify (`bugforge/select.py`)

Every mutation lands in exactly one of six outcomes:

| outcome | meaning |
|---|---|
| `ADMITTED` | the suite caught it and it scored well enough to be a challenge |
| `TEST_GAP` | the covering tests ran and stayed green: a real coverage hole |
| `DROP_too_loud` | it broke so much of the suite that the trace gives it away |
| `DROP_low_score` | catchable, but too easy to be worth solving |
| `DROP_timeout` | it caused a hang |
| `DROP_catastrophic` | the tree stopped importing |

On the bundled tenacity run: 56 admitted, 48 test gaps, 16 dropped.

### 5. Describe (`cloud/describe.py`)

Generate a bug-ticket title and a one-line symptom, for example
"test_wait_arbitrary_sum raised TypeError". See
[the section on the model call](#the-one-model-call-and-what-it-is-not-allowed-to-say).

### 6. Persist (`cloud/handlers/fn_persist.py`)

Package the broken tree, write the challenge rows to DynamoDB, upload the public
tree and the sealed answer to their two separate S3 prefixes, and publish the
gap report. Each challenge is written as it is packaged, so a timeout loses the
tail of a run rather than the whole run.

---

## Difficulty is measured, not guessed

Each admitted challenge gets a score from 1 to 10 built from three measured
quantities:

```
d = min(displacement, 4) / 4        # stack frames between the failure and the bug
s = min(search_space, 20) / 20      # source files the failing test executes
n = 1 - min(noise * 40, 1)          # inverse of the fraction of the suite that went red

score = clamp(1, 10, 1 + 9 * (0.45*d + 0.25*s + 0.30*n) - name_leak)
```

**Displacement is weighted highest** because it is the thing being trained. A
bug whose traceback points straight at it is a typo hunt. A bug four frames
above where the exception surfaced is a real investigation. The bundled tenacity
challenge is a clean example: the `TypeError` is raised at `wait.py:107` and the
mutation is at `wait.py:51`, inside `__radd__`.

**Noise is inverted on purpose.** If one mutation turns half the suite red, the
intersection of the failures points at the cause immediately. A single quiet
failure gives you far less to triangulate from, so it scores higher.

**`name_leak` is a penalty.** If the failing test is called `test_radd` and the
broken function is `__radd__`, the name has given the answer away, so a full
point is subtracted.

**Bands are cut per repository, not at fixed thresholds.** Fixed cuts at 5 and 7
put 51 of tenacity's 56 bugs into "medium", which makes the label carry no
information and makes the filter that uses it useless. The score is only
meaningful relative to the rest of the repo anyway: a 6.5 is a hard bug in a
shallow codebase and an easy one in a deep one. Ties are not broken, so if a
third of the scores are identical the band holding them is larger than a third.
That is the honest answer.

---

## Grading

`cloud/handlers/fn_grade.py`. No model, no hidden tests, no heuristics.

1. **Patch hygiene via the AST**, before the tree is touched at all.
2. **Apply** the patch to a clean extraction of the broken tree. Line endings
   are normalised and the patch is newline-terminated, because `git apply`
   rejects a final hunk without a terminator, which is what a browser produces.
3. **Run the full suite**, not just the failing test, so a fix that breaks
   something else fails.
4. **Verdict.** All green is `PASS`. Otherwise `FAIL`, naming the tests still
   red. Hygiene failures are `REJECTED` with a reason.

The green check is `num_failed == 0 and returncode == 0 and passed > 0`. The
last clause is not redundant: a patch that ends the test process early and
quietly, such as `os.Exit(0)` in Go code, produces a run with no results that
otherwise looks identical to success.

**The grading function has no IAM permission to read the `answers/` prefix at
all.** It does not need one. The mutation was selected precisely because the
suite catches it, so a green suite is itself the proof. A separate function with
a different role serves the reveal, and only for a submission that has already
passed.

---

## Anti-cheat

`cloud/anti_cheat.py`, applied in two passes.

**Path rules, before anything is written:**
- a patch targeting no file is rejected
- a path outside the tree is rejected
- **a patch touching a test file is rejected**, so you cannot delete the failing
  test
- a file of the wrong language for the challenge is rejected

**Content rules, on the applied result:** the patched tree is diffed against the
original to catch changes that neutralise the suite rather than fix the bug.
Deleting a file is rejected. Leaving a file unparseable is rejected.

Separately, the live forge stream **masks file paths** (`......py:...`), because
a learner who can read the mutation's location off the stream has already solved
the challenge.

---

## The one model call, and what it is not allowed to say

Everything that decides anything, which mutation is made, which becomes a
challenge, how hard it is, and whether a fix is correct, is AST work and test
execution. Exactly one module writes prose: `cloud/describe.py`.

Its design is defensive by construction:

1. **The fallback is built first**, as a fixed template over facts the pipeline
   already computed. It always exists.
2. With `BUGFORGE_DISABLE_BEDROCK` set, the fallback is returned and the
   `anthropic` SDK is never imported.
3. Otherwise the model is asked for strict JSON, and a **hard post-check runs in
   code**. It rejects any output naming a file path, a line number, or any
   identifier appearing in the mutated line's enclosing scope, the module path,
   or the failing test id. Whole-word, case-insensitive. On rejection it retries
   once, then falls back.

So the model can make the description read better. It cannot leak the answer,
and if it is unavailable nothing degrades except prose.

---

## Accounts and sign-in

Sign-in is GitHub OAuth. It buys attribution and cross-device progress, and
nothing else: browsing, reading a traceback, editing a patch and being graded
all work signed out.

**Sessions are signed, not stored.** A session is an HS256 JWT carrying the
GitHub numeric id, login and avatar, and nothing else. There is no session
table and nothing to revoke; a session expires. A session grants exactly one
thing, the right to submit a patch as yourself, and nothing a stolen one could
do is worth a DynamoDB round trip on every request. The verification is
constant-time and `alg` is never read back out of the token.

**Identity comes only from the verified session.** No handler reads a user id
from a request body.

**Two secrets, not one.** The GitHub client secret is readable only by
`fn_auth`, because it can impersonate the whole application to GitHub. The
session signing key is readable by `fn_auth`, which signs, and `fn_api`, which
verifies. Collapsing them would hand every route the ability to talk to GitHub
as the app.

**The `state` token is signed and echoed in a short-lived cookie**, and both
copies must be present, identical and validly signed on the way back. Without
it an attacker can complete a sign-in in a victim's browser with their own
code, silently attaching the victim's submissions to the attacker's account.
The post-sign-in redirect is bounded to `WEB_ORIGIN`, because an open redirect
on a callback is how an OAuth flow turns into a phishing primitive.

**The cookie's attributes are named, not guessed**, because getting them wrong
is silent: the browser simply discards the cookie and signing in appears to do
nothing.

| `BUGFORGE_COOKIE_MODE` | attributes | when |
|---|---|---|
| `cross_site` | `HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=None` | app and API on different domains (Amplify and execute-api) |
| `same_origin` | `HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax` | one HTTPS origin serves both, so the cookie is first-party |
| `insecure` | `HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax` | plain-http localhost, where there is nothing to secure |

**Progress is merged, never chosen between.** The anonymous localStorage record
folds into the server record on sign-in, so solving a few signed out and then
signing in does not look like losing your work.

**`/signin/` is one route that is a sign-in page signed out and a sign-out page
signed in.** It owns no auth logic: it reads the same cached `GET /auth/me`
answer the header control reads, so the two cannot disagree. The header links
here rather than redirecting straight to github.com, so the page can say what
an account buys before sending anyone off-site to approve one.

## Features

### The forge

- One repo to a container image, its test dependencies installed at build time,
  its suite proved green in the image itself.
- Vetted repository list pinning a **commit per repository**, because a moving
  branch would silently change every challenge's line numbers.
- Coverage-guided candidate selection, so mutations only land on covered lines.
- Distributed Map fan-out with per-batch failure tolerance: most batches raising
  "no survivors" is the normal outcome, not an error.
- **Live forge stream.** The landing page replays a real run as it happens, each
  row showing the operator and verdict, with the location masked.

### Browsing

- **Repos** page: challenge count, test gap count, licence, language, and the
  difficulty spread per repository.
- **Challenge grid** with per-repo difficulty bands and solved ticks.
- **Gaps** page: every mutation the suite missed, with file, line, operator,
  enclosing function, and how many tests cover that line.
- Difficulty shown as its **three measured inputs**, never one opaque number,
  with an expandable explanation of what each one means.

### The solve screen

- **CodeMirror 6 editor** with Python and Go syntax, a real file tree, and tabs.
- **Traceback walker.** The parsed trace is a clickable spine; `alt+[` and
  `alt+]` step through frames, opening the file and jumping to the line.
- **Gutter marks** distinguishing the frame that raised from frames above it.
- **Test files open read-only**, with an explicit message when you try to type
  in one, because the suite is the grader.
- Breadcrumbs showing the enclosing class and function at the cursor.
- **Drafts persist** in localStorage, so a reload does not lose your edits.
- `ctrl+Enter` submits, `ctrl+F` finds, `alt+W` closes a tab.
- An attempt log with per-submission verdicts and the tests still failing.

### After a pass

- **Reveal**: the exact mutation, the original and mutated line, the operator,
  and a link to the real line on GitHub at the pinned commit.
- **Investigation replay**: which files you opened and when, drawn against the
  causal path from the crash to the bug, with a sentence on whether you were
  reading the right file.

### Accounts

- **GitHub OAuth**, with a hand-rolled HS256 session cookie. See
  [Accounts and sign-in](#accounts-and-sign-in) for the full design.
- A dedicated `/signin/` account screen, which is a sign-out screen once you
  are signed in, sharing one cached session answer with the header control.
- **Solved state is merged, never chosen between**: the anonymous localStorage
  record folds into the server record on sign-in, so solving a few signed out
  and then signing in does not look like losing your work.
- Leaderboard scored by summed difficulty, awarded once per challenge.
- **Profile** page: solved-versus-total dial, per-band progress, a year-long
  activity calendar, current and longest streak, fastest solve, and recent
  solves.

### Multi-language

- A `LanguageAdapter` seam (`bugforge/languages/`) covering token location, the
  coverage map, test running and failure extraction.
- **Python** and **Go** are both implemented, each with its own Dockerfile. Go
  ships a pre-warmed build cache in the image, because Lambda's only writable
  path is `/tmp` and an unset `GOCACHE` means recompiling the standard library
  before the first mutation runs.

### Operability

- One SAM template describes both the local and the deployed stack.
- Two S3 prefixes with genuinely different IAM, not a naming convention.
- Presigned URLs for public trees, with a TTL; answers are never presigned.
- **A no-AWS deploy** behind the same two storage seams, so one uvicorn process
  and a directory serve the whole app with no account and nothing billable.
- **Startup checks that refuse to serve** on a silent misconfiguration, rather
  than failing on the first person who tries to sign in.
- Themes, keyboard-first navigation, and a layout that works at phone width.

### Design system

- **Neo-brutalist**, built on four rules: elevation is a hard offset shadow and
  never a blur, every surface carries a thick ink border, corners are square
  because the radius scale is wiped, and colour is flat and saturated.
- Light is the primary theme, cream paper rather than white; dark is the same
  tokens re-pointed.
- **Every colour resolves through one set of CSS custom properties**, so the
  re-skin cost no component edits and CodeMirror follows the theme because its
  stylesheet is written in the same variables.
- The theme is one attribute on `<html>`, applied before first paint, so a
  light viewer never sees a dark flash.
- Contrast is checked per token, and the ratios are recorded beside the values.

| Data | **DynamoDB** | challenges, gaps, submissions, progress, leaderboard |
| Data | **S3** | public trees and sealed answers, under separate IAM |
| Auth | **Secrets Manager** | session signing key and GitHub OAuth credentials |
| Runtime | **Python 3.12** on Lambda container images | the whole pipeline |
| No-AWS runtime | **FastAPI** + **uvicorn** (`server/app.py`) | one ASGI process standing in for API Gateway and three Lambdas |
| No-AWS storage | **SQLite** + the filesystem (`cloud/local_store.py`) | objects of the boto3 S3 and DynamoDB shapes, so no call site changes |
| Web | **Next.js 16**, React 19, Tailwind 4, CodeMirror 6 | the app, editor and traceback walker |
| Tests | **pytest**, **vitest** | 403 Python tests, 126 web tests |

The deployed path (Lambda, API Gateway, Step Functions, Amplify Hosting) is the
same template, so this is not a demo build that has diverged from the real one.

## Running it

There are two ways to run the whole thing on one machine. Neither needs an AWS
account and neither is billable.

### The short way: no AWS at all

One Python process serves the API, grades submissions in-process, and keeps its
state in a directory. Nothing is containerised except the repo checkout the
grader needs.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt fastapi uvicorn

# which repo, where the store lives, and how the cookie is attributed
export PYTHONPATH=.
export BUGFORGE_LOCAL_STORE=./local_output/store
export BUCKET=bugforge-local
export REPO_NAME=jd__tenacity REPO_PACKAGE=tenacity REPO_LANGUAGE=python
export REPO_URL=https://github.com/jd/tenacity REPO_DIR=./cache/jd__tenacity
export TABLE_CHALLENGES=challenges TABLE_GAPS=gaps TABLE_SUBMISSIONS=submissions
export TABLE_LEADERBOARD=leaderboard TABLE_PROGRESS=progress
export BUGFORGE_LOCAL_GRADING=1 BUGFORGE_DISABLE_BEDROCK=1
export BUGFORGE_COOKIE_MODE=insecure BUGFORGE_PUBLIC_BASE=/api
export WEB_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3100
export OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3100/api/auth/callback

# optional, for real sign-in: a GitHub OAuth app registered against the
# callback above. Without these, browsing works and submitting is refused
# with a 401.
export GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=... GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=... SESSION_SECRET=...

python -m uvicorn server.app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3102

# the web app, in another terminal, proxying /api/* to the line above
cd web && BUGFORGE_LOCAL_API=http://127.0.0.1:3102 npm run dev -- --port 3100
```

Then open `http://localhost:3100`.

Keep those exports in a file under `local_output/`, which is gitignored
wholesale, so a client secret cannot reach a commit. On Git Bash, set
`MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` first: it rewrites `/api` into a Windows path before the
process ever sees it, and every tree fetch then fails on an unparseable URL.

The proxy is not a convenience. The session cookie is HttpOnly, and on plain
http a browser keeps such a cookie only for a localhost origin, so proxying is
what makes the API first-party to the web app and lets the GitHub callback be a
stable `http://localhost:3100/api/auth/callback`.

`GET /` on the API answers with which repo is loaded, whether the store is
local or AWS, whether grading is in-process, and whether sign-in is configured.

### The full way: the real stack on LocalStack

This runs the actual SAM template, the Step Functions workflow and the two S3
prefixes with their different IAM. Full detail, including every failure mode
and why it happens, is in [`infra/local/README.md`](infra/local/README.md).

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-local.txt

# 1. the backend
docker compose -f infra/local/docker-compose.yml up -d

# 2. the image for one vetted repo (slow the first time, on purpose)
./infra/docker/build_local.sh jd__tenacity

# 3. the stack
./infra/local/deploy.sh jd__tenacity

# 4. the challenges
python infra/local/seed.py phase5_output

# 5. the HTTP API, left running
./infra/local/start_api.sh jd__tenacity

# 6. the web app, in another terminal
cd web && BUGFORGE_LOCAL_API=http://127.0.0.1:3101 npm run dev -- --port 3100
```

Then open `http://localhost:3100`.

## What is real and what is a local stand-in

This matters for anyone evaluating the project, so it is stated plainly rather
than buried.

**Real and running locally:** the full eight-stage pipeline code, the scoring,
the grader, the anti-cheat rules, all sixteen API routes, the Step Functions
definition, the IAM split between the two S3 prefixes, and every screen.

**Substituted locally, with the reason:**

- **Forging a new repository** needs a container-image Lambda, and LocalStack
  community refuses to start one: "Container images are a Pro feature". The
  pipeline code is unchanged and correct; LocalStack's Lambda cannot *invoke*
  it. Running it needs LocalStack Pro or a real AWS deploy.
- **The bundled challenges** were produced by running that real pipeline
  offline. `infra/local/seed.py` loads the output into the local stack, writing
  exactly what `fn_persist` writes: the same rows, the same S3 keys. It
  substitutes for the runtime, not for the pipeline.
- **Grading** runs inside the API process locally rather than as a separately
  invoked Lambda, for the same reason. It is the same `fn_grade.handler` in the
  same image, producing the same verdicts.
- **S3 and DynamoDB**, on the no-AWS path only, are a directory and a SQLite
  file behind the same two client seams. The handlers make the same calls.
- **Sign-in** is the real GitHub OAuth flow on both local paths, given an OAuth
  app. A fixed local user exists as a convenience for running without one, and
  is refused anywhere that is not plain-http localhost, because over HTTPS it
  would hand every visitor the same account and therefore one shared solved
  history and one leaderboard row.

Every local switch is ignored unless its own environment variable is set, and
the ones that would weaken a deployment refuse at startup rather than at
request time, so a real deployment cannot honour a flag that leaks into its
environment.

## Verification

- **403 Python tests** covering the operators, the coverage map, selection and
  scoring, packaging, the anti-cheat rules, grading, each handler, the OAuth
  flow driven end to end through the ASGI app, and the startup checks.
- **126 web tests** covering patch construction, traceback parsing for both
  languages, the tar reader, session merging, solve scope rules, reveal
  formatting and the profile arithmetic.
- The container build runs the target repository's own suite and **fails the
  build** if it is not green, so a bad baseline is caught at build time.
- The image build also fails on a `src/` layout repository, because pytest would
  then run against the unmutated installed copy and grade every challenge as
  already fixed.
